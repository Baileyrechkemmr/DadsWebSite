# 🔒 SECURITY CHECKLIST - IMPORTANT!

## ⚠️ **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**

### 🚨 **AWS Credentials Exposed**
During our debugging session, your AWS credentials were visible:
- Access Key ID: `YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- Secret Access Key: `YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

### 🛡️ **SECURITY ACTIONS TO TAKE:**

#### 1. **Rotate AWS Credentials** (Recommended)
```bash
# AWS Console → IAM → Users → [your-user] → Security Credentials
# 1. Create new Access Key
# 2. Update .env file with new credentials  
# 3. Update Render environment variables
# 4. Delete old Access Key
```

#### 2. **Limit IAM Permissions**
Ensure your AWS user only has S3 permissions:
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:DeleteObject",
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::ominisword-images",
                "arn:aws:s3:::ominisword-images/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

#### 3. **Secure Environment Variables**
- ✅ Never commit `.env` file to git (already done)
- ✅ Use Render's encrypted environment variables
- ✅ Regenerate Django SECRET_KEY for production

## 🔐 **PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST**

### Before Render Deployment:
- [ ] Generate new AWS IAM user with limited S3 permissions
- [ ] Create new Django SECRET_KEY
- [ ] Set DEBUG=False for production
- [ ] Update all environment variables in Render

### After Deployment:
- [ ] Test image loading on live site
- [ ] Verify S3 signed URLs work correctly
- [ ] Delete old AWS credentials

**Priority: HIGH** - Address AWS credential security before deployment! 🚨
